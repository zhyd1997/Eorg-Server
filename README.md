This is the backend of [Eorg](https://github.com/zhyd1997/Eorg), and it is used to:

- user authentication.
- store pictures uploaded on client.
- store JSON data which generated by rich text editor (next version).
- compile `.tex` files which parsed from JSON data.
- store `pdf` files, `.tex` source code and zip files. (the users could retrive it from FE.)

## Before start

1. [TeXLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) must be installed to compile `.tex` files if
   you want to integrate the BE with FE.

2. Add a `.env` file in the project root folder.

```env
